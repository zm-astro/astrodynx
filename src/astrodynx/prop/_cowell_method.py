"""General implementations of Cowell's method for propagating orbits under perturbing forces."""


class OrbDynx(NamedTuple):
    """Orbital dynamics configuration for Cowell's method propagation.

    This NamedTuple encapsulates the essential components needed for orbital
    propagation using Cowell's method, including the differential equation terms,
    static arguments, and optional event detection.

    Attributes:
        terms: The differential equation terms defining the
            orbital dynamics. Typically an ODETerm containing the vector field
            function that computes accelerations from gravitational and
            perturbation forces. Refer to `diffrax.ODETerm <https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/api/terms/#diffrax.ODETerm>`_ for more details.
        args: Static arguments passed to the differential equation.
            Common arguments include gravitational parameter (mu), perturbation
            parameters (J2, R_eq), and event thresholds (rmin).
            Defaults to {"mu": 1.0}.
        event: Event detection configuration for terminating propagation early when specific conditions are met (e.g., ground impact, apogee passage). Refer to `diffrax.Event <https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/api/events/#diffrax.Event>`_ for more details.

    Notes:
        This class is designed to work with the diffrax library for solving
        ordinary differential equations. The terms should define the complete
        orbital dynamics including all relevant forces and perturbations.

        The args parameter uses JAX's PyTree structure, allowing for efficient
        compilation and automatic differentiation of the propagation process.

    Examples:
        Basic two-body orbital dynamics:

        >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
        >>> import diffrax
        >>> import astrodynx as adx
        >>> def vector_field(t, x, args):

        ...     terms=diffrax.ODETerm(vector_field),
        ...     args={"mu": 1.0}
        ... )

        With J2 perturbations and event detection:

        >>> def perturbed_field(t, x, args):
        ...     acc = adx.gravity.point_mass_grav(t, x, args)
        ...     acc += adx.gravity.j2_acc(t, x, args)

    This function solves the orbital dynamics differential equation using a

            Must be positive for forward propagation.
        dt: Fixed time step size for integration in canonical time units. Smaller values increase accuracy but require more computational time.

    Notes:
        This function uses a constant step size controller, which means the
        integrator will take exactly dt-sized steps regardless of local error.
        This can be more efficient than adaptive methods but may sacrifice
        accuracy in regions where the dynamics change rapidly.

        The solution is saved at the initial time (t0=True) and at every
        integration step (steps=True), providing a complete trajectory.

            - result: Integration termination status

        Refer to `diffrax.Solution <https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/api/solution/#diffrax.Solution>`_ for more details.

    Notes:
        The adaptive step size controller automatically adjusts the time step
        to maintain the specified error tolerances. This results in smaller
        steps during periods of rapid change (e.g., near periapsis) and larger
        steps during smoother motion (e.g., near apoapsis).

        The initial step size is set to 1% of the total integration time (t1 * 0.01),
        which provides a reasonable starting point for most orbital scenarios.

        The solution is saved at the initial time and at every accepted step,
        providing a complete trajectory with optimal time resolution.

        Orbital propagation with adaptive steps:

    Notes:
        This function is ideal when you need the orbital state at specific
        times (e.g., for comparison with observations, mission planning, or
        analysis at predetermined epochs). The integrator uses adaptive
        stepping internally but interpolates to provide output at exactly
        the requested times.

        The max_steps parameter is set to None, allowing unlimited steps
        to ensure the integration can reach all requested time points.

        If any requested time in ts is beyond t1, those points will not
        be computed. Ensure t1 >= max(ts) for complete coverage.
